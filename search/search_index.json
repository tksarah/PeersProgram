This will be our third recruitment cycle, and based on the lessons learned from previous rounds, we have refined the program to make it more sustainable and more accessible for participants. This initiative is designed not only for technical contributors but for a wide range of community members. We warmly invite you to join us as partners in shaping the future of Astar. Strengthening Astar Through Decentralization One of the core values at the heart of Astar Network is decentralization. Decentralization is not just an ideal\u2014it is the foundation that supports the network\u2019s resilience, efficiency, and long-term sustainability. As nodes spread across the world and more diverse participants join, Astar becomes stronger, fairer, and more trustworthy. The Peers Program is a concrete initiative to advance this decentralization. By bringing together the power of our community, we aim to grow Astar into a truly global and sustainable network. Purpose The goal of this program is to promote decentralization within the Astar Network by expanding community\u2011driven node operations across the globe. We aim to encourage participation from diverse regions and build a structure that enhances the network\u2019s robustness and sustainability. Target Regions The regions we are focusing on are listed below. However, the initiative remains open to participants from all regions. South America Africa West Asia Southeast Asia Australia Program Structure (Milestones) Milestone 1: January 2026 \u2013 Recruitment of new participants (Improvement: Clear definition of continuation requirements) Milestone 2: Annual incentives for ongoing node operators (Improvement: Emphasis on long-term support) Milestone 3: Mechanism for sustaining community nodes Rewards & Funding Allocation Improvement: Shift from one-time payments to monthly rewards with continuation requirements clearly defined Participation Requirements Node specifications: Archive node, uptime of 80% or higher, Telemetry connection, Raspberry Pi 4 or above Improvement: Non-technical participants are welcome; selection will be made by community representatives","title":"Home"},{"location":"#strengthening-astar-through-decentralization","text":"One of the core values at the heart of Astar Network is decentralization.
