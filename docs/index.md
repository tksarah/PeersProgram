Dear Astar Community,

To everyone who has participated in the Peers Program so far, and to all of you who support the network every day, we extend our deepest gratitude.
This will be our third recruitment cycle, and based on the lessons learned from previous rounds, we have refined the program to make it more sustainable and more accessible for participants.
This initiative is designed not only for technical contributors but for a wide range of community members. We warmly invite you to join us as partners in shaping the future of Astar.

## Strengthening Astar Through Decentralization

One of the core values at the heart of Astar Network is decentralization.
Decentralization is not just an ideal—it is the foundation that supports the network’s resilience, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
As nodes spread across the world and more diverse participants join, Astar becomes stronger, fairer, and more trustworthy.

The Peers Program is a concrete initiative to advance this decentralization.
By bringing together the power of our community, we aim to grow Astar into a truly global and sustainable network.


## Purpose

The goal of this program is to promote decentralization within the Astar Network by expanding community‑driven node operations across the globe.
We aim to encourage participation from diverse regions and build a structure that enhances the network’s robustness and sustainability.


## Target Regions

The regions we are focusing on are listed below. However, the initiative remains open to participants from all regions.

* South America
* Africa
* West Asia
* Southeast Asia
* Australia
